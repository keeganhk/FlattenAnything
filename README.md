# Flatten Anything: Unsupervised Neural Surface Parameterization



This is the official implementation of **[[Flatten Anything Model (FAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14633)]**, an unsupervised neural architecture to achieve global free-boundary surface parameterization via learning point-wise mappings between 3D points on the target geometric surface and adaptively-deformed UV coordinates within the 2D parameter domain
